## üìÑ Abstract

This study presents a novel multi-stage method for enhancing the quality and resolution of satellite images from the EOS SAT-1 optical satellite. The proposed approach addresses the absence of clean ground truth data by training a *Distortion Network* to emulate realistic degradation, followed by the use of a *Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN)* trained on synthetically generated image pairs.

Special focus is given to maintaining the stability of agro-indices such as NDVI during enhancement, which is critical for agricultural monitoring applications.

### Key Contributions:
- A synthetic training data generation pipeline tailored to EOS SAT-1 imagery.
- A GAN-based super-resolution approach capable of enhancing real satellite images.
- A lightweight post-processing stage that preserves statistical properties and NDVI values.
- Quantitative and qualitative validation of the approach on real and synthetic data.
